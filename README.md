# dropdown-button

An example that I prepared for my self-challenging process, the design of which was utilized through codepen. The dropdown feature of the button is the most important detail for the working example. I had prepared a drop-down menu before, and specially for this challenge, I adapted this idea on a button. I will make changes and additions to it over time.
